# TikTok Project - Building a Machine Learning Model
 
This repository contains the code and documentation for a machine learning project predicting whether a TikTok video expresses a claim or an opinion. This project was developed as part of the Google Advanced Data Analytics Certification.  
Project Background: 
TikTok receives a large number of video reports, and manually moderating them is a time-consuming and resource-intensive task. This project aims to develop a machine learning model to predict whether a video is a claim or an opinion, thereby automating the moderation process and improving efficiency.  
## Methodology: 
 
* Data Exploration: Exploratory data analysis was performed on the provided dataset to understand the variables and their relationships.
 
* Visualization: Data visualizations were used to gain further insights into the relationships between variables and identify potential trends.
 
## Model Development: Two machine learning models were explored:
 
* Random Forest Classifier: This model was chosen due to its ability to handle high dimensional data and its robustness to overfitting.
 
* XGBoost Classifier: A gradient boosting algorithm known for its high performance.
 
 
 
## Model Evaluation: 
Both models were trained and tested on the provided data, and performance metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score were used to evaluate their effectiveness.
 
## Champion Model Selection: 
The Random Forest model exhibited superior performance compared to the XGBoost classifier and was chosen as the champion model.

## Project Results: 
The Random Forest model achieved a high accuracy and F1 score, demonstrating its ability to effectively predict whether a TikTok video expresses a claim or an opinion. This model can be implemented to automate the moderation process and improve the efficiency of TikTok's content review system. 
Further Improvements: 
 
* Explore additional features and data sources to enhance model performance.
 
* Implement a web-based interface for users to interact with the model.
 
* Deploy the model to a production environment for real-time video moderation.
